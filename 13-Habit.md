# Liekkas Venture 13: Habit

Even a little habit makes a big difference.
I'd like to recommend a well-known book about habit: 
The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business?
It explores the science behind habit creation and reformation.
We're going to talk about habit tomorrow. Welcome to join us!
