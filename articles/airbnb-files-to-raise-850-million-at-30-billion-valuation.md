The home-sharing company Airbnb Inc. is raising $850 million, according to a disclosure filed with the state of Delaware.  
The equity round values the San Francisco-based company at $30 billion, people told Bloomberg in June. The private stock market company Equidate provided Airbnb’s July 28 filing.  
A spokesman for Airbnb declined to comment. The filing doesn’t disclose who is making the investment.  
Airbnb has been restrained about how much capital it takes on compared with ride-sharing company Uber Technologies Inc., which has raised more than $15 billion in equity and debt. Airbnb and Uber are often discussed together because they were founded within a year of each other and have come to define the on-demand economy. Uber is valued at almost $68 billion.  
In July 2015, Airbnb raised $1.6 billion at a $25.6 billion valuation, according to Equidate. With the $850 million disclosed in last week’s filing, Airbnb has raised about $3.2 billion in equity, according to Equidate.  
Airbnb in June secured a $1 billion debt facility from JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley.
