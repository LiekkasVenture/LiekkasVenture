A month has passed away since last Liekkas activity.
I was occupied with work at the whole of August.
Until today, my project had come the end. haha~
It's not esay to stick with one thing. 
I hope we can keep Liekkas as long as possible. 
Finally, we had the 9th Liekkas activity - Coffee.

I go to drink coffee at the cafe occasionally.
It's enjoyable to see flower image on the top of coffeee.
Most of people drink coffee for refreshing themselves, but it maybe doesn't have effect on some people, even the contrary effect.
For me, it refreshes me so much that I couldn't sleep well at night.-_-
Even thought that, sometimes I couldn't help myself to have a cup of coffee.

You will find an interesting phenomenon that coffee culture permeate into everyday life gradually.
When someone invites you to have coffee, it means that he want to chat with you. Right?
