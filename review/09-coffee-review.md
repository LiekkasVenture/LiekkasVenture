# 09 Coffee Review

> Batur

Both Sammy and I are busy on September. So Liekkas had been skipped for several weeks. On Sunday, Sammy said her little target was to keep Liekkas as long as possible. I was touched to hear this. Indeed, we both knew it’s not easy to maintain a community continuously. Luckily, we have the same goal, and we communicate sincerely. So I have faith that we can make Liekkas go further.


The topic we had discuss last Sunday was Coffee. At the beginning, we talked the news about billionaire Wang Jianlin and his little target. And later, we exchanged our ideas of the mooncake incident in Alibaba. Sammy and I had different opinions about the HR department in Alibaba. I was on the side of the programmers who were fired, and I thought Alibaba was over reacted. Before we started our topic, we watched three videos. We were in a cafe, and it’s not vey quiet at that time. So we didn’t turn on the video loud. 


In China, we preferred tea over coffee obviously. But in western country, coffee is a part of life. People drank it everyday. Honestly, we knew little about coffee. Two years ago, I had a coffee machine. At that time, I was excited to play it. Now I had seldom time to cook coffee(my coffee machine was left at hometown), I always liked coffee. I would try to make it as a part of my life in the future. :P


After we had finished our conversation, we had a dinner together. We both agree that we can make Liekkas better. This is the first time we write Liekkas review. One reason is that we can practice English writing through this way. By writing down, we can leave something behind that we may read in the future. 


The next Liekkas gathering will be on 30th, September. We hope more and more Interesting people will join us.
